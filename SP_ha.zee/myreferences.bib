The basic idea of vehicle detection is detecting “blocks,” which reflects the position of the vehicle in images or videos. Besides, this paper discusses 3D vehicle detection algorithms based on stereo perception, which originated from advanced planar vehicle detection perception. Finally, this paper summarizes the vehicle detection algorithms in recent years in terms of the difference between the feature extraction approach and the perceived results. It proposes hypotheses for further in-depth study of the vehicle detection algorithms.}

 	abstract="This paper proposes a method to detect vehicle in the Hsuehshan Tunnel. Vehicle detection in the Tunnel is a challenging problem due to use of heterogeneous cameras, varied camera setup locations, low resolution videos, poor tunnel illumination, and reflected lights on the tunnel wall. Furthermore, the vehicles to be detected vary greatly in shape, color, size, and appearance. The proposed method is based on background subtraction and Deep Belief Network (DBN) with three hidden layers architecture. Experimental results show that it can detect vehicles in he Tunnel effectively. The experimental accuracy rate is 96.59{\%}.",
