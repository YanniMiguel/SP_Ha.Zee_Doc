The basic idea of vehicle detection is detecting “blocks,” which reflects the position of the vehicle in images or videos. Besides, this paper discusses 3D vehicle detection algorithms based on stereo perception, which originated from advanced planar vehicle detection perception. Finally, this paper summarizes the vehicle detection algorithms in recent years in terms of the difference between the feature extraction approach and the perceived results. It proposes hypotheses for further in-depth study of the vehicle detection algorithms.}

Vehicle detection in the Tunnel is a challenging problem due to use of heterogeneous cameras, varied camera setup locations, low resolution videos, poor tunnel illumination, and reflected lights on the tunnel wall. Furthermore, the vehicles to be detected vary greatly in shape, color, size, and appearance. The proposed method is based on background subtraction and Deep Belief Network (DBN) with three hidden layers architecture. Experimental results show that it can detect vehicles in he Tunnel effectively. The experimental accuracy rate is 96.59{\%}.",

	abstract = {Air quality and reduction of emissions in the transport sector are determinant factors in achieving a sustainable global climate. The monitoring of emissions in traffic routes can help to improve route planning and to design strategies that may make the pollution levels to be reduced. In this work, a method which detects the pollution levels of transport vehicles from the images of IP cameras by means of computer vision techniques and neural networks is proposed. Specifically, for each sequence of images, a homography is calculated to correct the camera perspective and determine the real distance for each pixel. Subsequently, the trajectory of each vehicle is computed by applying convolutional neural networks for object detection and tracking algorithms. Finally, the speed in each frame and the pollution emitted by each vehicle are determined. Experimental results on several datasets available in the literature support the feasibility and scalability of the system as an emission control strategy.}
