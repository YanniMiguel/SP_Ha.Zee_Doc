\section{Overview of the Current State of Technology}
\label{sec:overview}
The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) expressed on its website that monitoring air quality is essential in reducing air pollution and they plan to protect the environment and public health by strengthening their air quality monitoring systems \cite{DENR2020}.

An example of an air quality monitoring system that the DENR uses is the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS). \cite{DENR_ND}. DOAS captures light that passes through the atmosphere, to measure different wavelengths that were absorbed by different gasses. This method can accurately measure trace gasses absorption and it is simpler and less expensive to operate. DOAS, however, is greatly affected by turbulence in the atmosphere \cite{PlattEtAl2008}. DENR also has particulate matter stations that record $PM_{2.5}$ and $PM_{10}$ in the atmosphere. \cite{DENR_ND}

DOAS equipment needs frequent maintenance to be able to operate normally. In a news report by \cite{enano_subingsubing_2019} regarding air pollution at EDSA it was stated that the maintenance of this equipment requires “hundreds of thousands of pesos”.

Currently, The way to access the data from the AQMS stations is through the website (https://air.emb.gov.ph/ambient-air-quality-monitoring/) and the play store application. Figure \ref{fig:PAQIApp} shows the contents of the application.\\

In the mobile application disclaimer, it is stated that the system audits are irregular and all data are subject to quality Assurance and quality control. This means that the end user may not get the accurate data that they expect when using the application. Moreover, monitoring stations are not online 24/7 which makes the data less accessible.


\section{Problem Statement}
	Air pollution has become a global problem over the years. As stated by \cite{Akimoto2004}, the availability of the CO2 concentrations on the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS) instrument in 1981 shows high concentrations of the greenhouse gas over tropical Asia, Africa, and South America. Not only does this data provide evidence that this has become an international issue,but it also shows how fossil fuel combustion can have an impact on air quality. 

The Philippines, a country located in tropical Asia, is not devoid of these issues. An article by \cite{abano_2019} states that a 2018 study by the World Health Organization reports the Philippines has ranked third among the countries with air pollution-related deaths. These deaths are tied to harmful particles entering a person’s lungs, which can lead to multiple different ailments and diseases: heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory infections, to name a few.

Air pollution can come from different sources, whether it be from stationary constructs like factories or mobile sources such as cars. \cite{EMB_2015}  An air quality status report by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (2015) shows that 65\% of air pollutants come from these mobile sources. This worsened as the EMB’s official site \cite{EMB_2018} states that based on the Emissions Inventory of 2018, the pollutant contribution of mobile sources has increased to  74\%. In places where traffic is congested could be a huge contributing factor to vehicular emissions. \cite{vergel_yai2000} state that the congestion in the roads of Metro Manila contributes to the worsening air quality, especially in the vicinity of the road environment.

A key component of these emissions is particulate matter (PM): $PM_{2.5}$ and $PM_{10}$. PM is a measure of solid or liquid particles in the air that are inhalable, this includes dust, smoke, and dirt \cite{EPA_2022}. Accordingly, $PM_{10}$ is the measure of inhalable particulate matter in the air that is at most 10 micrometers in diameter, similarly, $PM_{2.5}$ is the measure of inhalable particulate matter in the air that is at most 2.5 micrometers in diameter. US EPA \citeyear{EPA_2022} additionally states that microscopic particulate matter particles can be inhaled and cause them to get to the lungs or the bloodstream which can lead to serious health problems, with $PM_{2.5}$ having the greatest risk.

In the country’s attempt to mitigate the atmospheric issues, the Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999 (Republic Act No. 8749) was passed. \cite{FAO} It entails the resolution of creating a national program of air pollution management, mainly focusing on pollution prevention. Two decades later and the country still sees increasing pollutants in the air and does not show signs of the improvement that was planned.

In addition to creating air pollution management programs, the Philippine Clean Air Act also aimed to utilize mass media communication to create awareness and active participation in air quality planning and monitoring. Considering that the available technology dedicated to monitoring the air quality in the country is sparsely spread throughout the country, being accessible to more citizens can help in creating awareness at a lower cost. With the aforementioned said, a system that could satisfy that goal can be created with newer technologies that were not present in the decades prior. Thus, Ha.Zee was constructed, a system that can gather information from vehicles – one of the biggest contributors to air pollution and provide an estimate of emissions produced, as a solution to these problems. 


\section{Research Objectives}
\label{sec:researchobjectives}

\subsection{General Objective}
\label{sec:generalobjective}


The general objective of the study is to develop an application that calculates the location’s average amount of  fine particulate matter ($PM_{2.5}$) emission from vehicles through the use of a vehicle detection system. This system will identify the vehicles on the street from a live camera feed. The system will integrate the values of $PM_{2.5}$  of different vehicles, which will be utilized to assign values to on-screen vehicles for their total average to be calculated. The average $PM_{2.5}$ value will then be displayed on the screen for the user to see.

\section{Scope and Limitations of the Research}
\label{sec:scopelimitations}
This application mainly focused on the PM2.5 emitted by traffic in the Philippines, where the researchers reside as of writing the paper. Thus, it will only be set up and used on vehicles that travel within the country. For this reason, this project has some significant difficulties in using existing databases of vehicles that are mainly found locally (i.e. jeepneys and tricycles), with little to no readily available databases existing to be utilized in the study. To avoid said vehicles from not being detected, the researchers opted to take pictures and videos of the vehicles in traffic to be used as training data. These vehicles were recorded on a smartphone and were uploaded in Roboflow, which was used to annotate them as their respective vehicle type. 

However, since the vehicles with no existing databases are taken and curated by the researchers within a small time frame, this could lead to inaccuracies as the frequency of a specific vehicle appearing on the road when recording is not guaranteed. Thus, lacking in representation compared to other common vehicles such as cars.

Furthermore, this study will be utilizing the YOLOv5 object identification framework and is thus limited to the features of that version. Any other features and upgrades that are present in future versions of the framework will not be included in the study.

\section{Significance of the Research}
\label{sec:significance}

The main objective of this study is to create an application that helps its users identify the $PM_{2.5}$ levels of a traffic congested area through a video over the road. It serves as an example of how computer vision can be utilized to get an estimate of the pollutants in an area via identifying the vehicles they come from and the amount of $PM_{2.5}$ they produce. This poses benefits to users that want to acquire information on the pollutant levels in traffic-congested areas. Civilians such as joggers are likely to plan their travel accordingly to avoid areas if $PM_{2.5}$ levels get too high.

For the environmental sector, this study can help contribute to air pollution awareness in the country, in which such data can be utilized when creating plans and protocols to combat the rising concern for the country’s air quality. The system is also open source so it is a benefit for the general public to use without needing a full set of gear to check on pollution levels.

Lastly, as interest in the computer vision field of vehicle identification and recognition systems increases, this study can contribute to future research in said field. The study can be of help to future researchers on the topics of computer vision and tracking vehicular greenhouse gas emissions. This may also provide data to vehicle image databases through the contribution of local vehicles from the Philippines.
