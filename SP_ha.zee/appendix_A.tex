Figure \ref{fig:cmd_help} shows the command line help for the “VehicleDetect” program. This helps the user to determine what the different arguments do and what is needed to run the program. This can be accessed via the terminal by inputting the command “python VehicleDetect.py -–help” or “python VehicleDetect.py -h”

\section{Log File}

To record the data, the results were saved in a CSV file as shown in Figure N.2. The recorded data was written using the current frame that it was recorded in, not the average, hence why the values on the recorded data vary a lot between time periods.
